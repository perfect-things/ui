Changelog
=========


## v10.0.0 *(2025-07-01)*
- Thousand thanks to Svelte team, for a long week of hard work, that was wasted on rewriting this library, to make it compatible with Svelte v5. Hopefully this is the last time.
- Added new property: `shortcut` the `Tooltip` component.


### Breaking changes
- All v4 events (e.g. `on:change`) are now loosing the colon (e.g. `onchange`).
- Context of event handlers may need to be "fixed" by arrow-functions, e.g.
  - before: `<Button on:click={handleClick}></Button>`
  - after: `<Button onclick={e => handleClick(e)}></Button>`

## v9.4.1 *(2024-01-07)*
- Add `title` attribute to the multiselect `Combobox` input, so that when it's too long, the value can be read easily.


## v9.4.0 *(2024-01-04)*
- Add `multiselect` option to the `Combobox`.

- Change tooltip to ticks in `Range` component, for better accessibility.


## v9.2.1 *(2023-10-14)*
- `Tag` should not be clickable (or focusable) by default. It can be made interactive by adding the new `clickable` attribute.


## v9.2.0 *(2023-10-13)*
- New component: `Range`.


## v9.1.2, v9.1.1, v9.1.0 *(2023-09-27)*

- Add `hideTip` and more, to `Popover`.
- Add `useNativeOnMobile` to `InputDate`.
- Fix `Popover` z-index (so that it shows over dialogs)
- Many other smaller bugfixes and improvements.


## v9.0.5 *(2023-09-22)*
- Reduce `Dialog's` `z-index` so that the popups from the dialog show up on top of it.


## v9.0.4, v9.0.3, v9.0.2, v9.0.1 *(2023-09-16)*
- Make `title` optional for `Panel`.
- Add `ANIMATION_SPEED` to utils/properties.
- Correct `FOCUSABLE_SELECTOR` (it's a constant, not a svelte store).


## v9.0.0 *(2023-09-09)*
- **New**: added `Utils` page in the docs with APIs to the utility functions exposed by the library.
- `Tooltip` was simplified and now the positioning ensures that the tooltip is always visible on the screen.
- `Popover` will now update its position when the window is resized.
- The tip of the `Tooltip` and `Popover` will now try to be centered on the target element (if the box was offset from the screen edge).
- Improved keyboard focus for notifications: when a notification is dismissed from the keyboard (Escape) the focus will be moved to the next available notification.
- Improved & standardised z-index throughout the components.
- Tweaked `Menu` positioning to update on window resize.
- Tweaked `MenuItem` for responsiveness (e.g. add ellipsis if the text is too long).



### Breaking changes
- The `events` property was dropped from the `Tooltip`, leaving *hover* and *focus* events as the default. For use cases when the *click* was needed, `Popover` should be used instead.
- `z-index` value of the `Popover` and `Tooltip` has been reduced from `9999` to `99`, so that it's closer to the content it describes. Ideally tooltips should slide under some other floating elements of the UI (like toolbars or drawers), while remaining above the content layer. This can be o overriden in the app's own css if needed.


----


## v8.4.5, v8.4.4 *(2023-08-26)*
- Standardise `InputSearch` UX: clear button and Escape-to-clear behaviour now works the same in different browsers.
- Enhance `Popover` so that it updates its position after it detects a content change.
- Expose `Popover`'s `updatePosition` function.
- Tweak the dropdown-align function for popover.


## v8.4.3 *(2023-08-25)*
- Fix `InputRadio` group block padding.


## v8.4.2, v8.4.1, v8.4.0 *(2023-08-24)*
- **New:** `Popover` component. If a `Dialog` and `Tooltip` had a child - this would be it. It's a container that can be opened like a dialog, but will be attached to the target element (like a tooltip). It's a great way to display additional information or actions for a specific element on the page. It can contain other components (e.g. buttons) and can serve as a free-form menu.
- Fix popover above the target styling.
- Simplify & refactor `Tooltip` to share more code with `Popover`. Styling and core functionality is now almost the same, while the UX and usage remains a bit different.


## v8.3.3 *(2023-08-19)*
- Inputs with dropdowns (e.g. `Combobox` and `InputDate`) will not trigger page scroll on focus (in mobile Safari).
- `Combobox` dropdown will now auto-adjust its position when the virtual keyboard opens (in mobile Safari).
- `:focus` has been updated to `:focus-visible` for non-input elements, for a better look.


## v8.3.2 *(2023-08-18)*
- Improve `InputRadio` styling to look more like the rest of the inputs (e.g. checkbox).
- Standardise font sizes into css variables: `--ui-font-xs`=14px, `--ui-font-s`=15px, `--ui-font-m`=16px, `--ui-font-l`=17px, `--ui-font-xl`=22px
- Correct the symbol for Return (‚èé) in `Menu`.
- `Menu` can now be centered with the target button (using `align` attribute).
- Context `Menu` will now open above the long-pressed spot on mobile (by default).
- Pressing the same letter key, with the `Menu` open will now cycle through the items starting with that letter.
- Pressing space with the `Menu` open, while typing something quickly, will not trigger the click event on the currently selected item. This allows to type-to-highlight elements that contain space in the text. Pressing space standalone (while not typing), will trigger the click event.


## v8.3.1 *(2023-08-14)*
- Removed `--ui-margin-xl` and `--ui-margin-xxl` as they were not used.
- Merged `--ui-border-radius-s` with `--ui-border-radius` and changed to a rem value that calculates to the whole pixel (so that browsers would render it better).
- Fixed the `NotificationCenter` issue, where toasts would not close if navigated away from the page that initialises the component.
- Tweaked dialog border-radius to render a bit better (for dialog's header and footer).
- Aligned components heights (`Menu`, `Combobox`, and `InputRadio` items).
- Fixed `Menu`'s longpress event to not triger when moving the finger (touchmove should stop longpress).
- Improve navigation swipe event (swiping can now be triggered by any element that is not scrollable and has no scrollable ancestors).
- Increased `Menu` font size slightly, while decreasing it for everything (102% -> 100% on `body`).


## v8.3.0 *(2023-08-11)*
- **New:** `InputSearch` component. Not much more than `InputText`, except the search icon and (depending on the browser) - the clear button.
- Fixed a weird and edge-case issue with `Menu` on mobile Safari (#119).


## v8.2.0 *(2023-08-08)*
- `data` attribute in `Combobox` is deprecated. It will be removed in the next major version. Use `items` instead.
- `Combobox` and `Menu` now use the same align function (for consistency and performance) and there's no need to add `elevate` attribute to either of them, as both popups are rendered inside the `body` element and are only added to the DOM, when they are opened (to avoid polluting the DOM with unnecessary elements).


## v8.1.4 *(2023-07-31)*
- Improved `PushButton` pressed styling.
- Some buttons should now react faster on mobile (touch-action added to notification buttons and all inputs, selects and textareas).


## v8.1.3 *(2023-07-30)*
- `PushButton` now has better contrast (when pressed).
- Fixed `showMessage` style for long messages on mobile.
- Fixed password strength popup style.
- Docs: fancy font should be applied do docs only, not to the components.
- Docs: try swipeRight on mobile to open sidebar.
- Added touch-action: manipulation to `Label` and some other missing places.

- Small table style tweaks
- Docs improvements


## v8.1.1 *(2023-07-28)*

- `Combobox` and `InputDate` buttons should not be tabbable.
- `Combobox` and `InputDate` buttons should toggle the dropdown on click.


## v8.1.0 *(2023-07-28)*
- **New:** All inputs have a new attribute `labelOnTheLeft` which allows to move the label to the left of the input.


## v8.0.1 *(2023-07-26)*
- **New:** Check the platform on load and add a `mobile` or `desktop` class to the `html` element.
- Fixed: Menu separator is now aligned with menu items.
- Fixed: Notifications Archive "Clear all" button is now back to normal.


## v8.0.0 *(2023-07-25)*
- **New:** `Label` component.
- **New icons:** `sun` and `moon` for the dark-theme switchers.
- **Improvement:** `info`, `error` and `label` attributes are now supported on other inputs (`Combobox`, `InputDate`, `Select`, `ButtonToggle`, and `Toggle`).
- **Improvement:** all components now expose `element` and `inputElement` (if there is one (and only one)). The exceptions are `NotificationCenter` and `MessageBox`, due to their implementation.
- Added `title` attribute to `ButtonToggle`.
- Added `success` type for `MessageBox`.
- Fixed `selectable=false` not working on `Table`.
- Improved styling for `Dialog` and `MessageBox`.

### Breaking changes
- Color palette has been completely revamped for better accessibility (more contrast), consistency and simplicity (fewer colors and css variables).
- `Autocomplete` has been renamed to `Combobox` as this is what it really is.
- `Datepicker` has been renamed to `InputDate`.
- `Toaster` component has been removed. Use `NotificationCenter` instead.
- `Select` - HTML structure has changed: `.select-wrap select` --> `.select .input-inner .input-row select`
- `Table` - CSS classes have changed from `.table-wrapper table.table` --> `.table table`
- `Toggle` - HTML structure has changed from `.toggle .toggle-inner .toggle-scroller input` --> `.toggle .toggle-inner .toggle-label .toggle-scroller input`
- `drawBorders` attribute has been removed from `Dialog`, while header and footer styling has been improved for all dialogs.
- These components previously exposed `_this`, which is now called `element`: `Button`, `Checkbox`, `InputMath`, `PushButton`, `Table`

### Color palette - mapping from v7 to v8 colors:
- `--ui-color-text-dark-1` --> `--ui-color-text-1`
- `--ui-color-text-dark-2` --> `--ui-color-text-2`
- `--ui-color-border-dark-1` --> `--ui-color-border-1`
- `--ui-color-border-dark-2` --> `--ui-color-border-2`
- `--ui-color-background-light-2` --> `--ui-color-background-1`
- `--ui-color-background-dark-2` --> `--ui-color-background-2`
- `--ui-color-highlight-dark-2` --> `--ui-color-highlight-1`

- **Improved:** `InputMath` component: support for `()` characters, to allow for more complex expressions.

### Breaking changes

#### Checkbox
- HTML structure changed `input` --> `.checkbox .checkbox-row input`
- `on:change` is called with a svelte event instead of the native one, so: `e.target.checked` is now `e.detail.checked`

#### InputMath
- HTML structure changed `.input-math-wrapper input` --> `.input-math .input-inner .input-math-row input`

- Updated docs to reflect the above changes
- Docs API table is now alphabetically sorted
- Components don't use `$$props` anymore, as it was causing issues with the `class` prop. Instead, the props are now explicitly passed down to the component. This is a good thing to do, as it makes the components more explicit and easier to understand.


----


## v4.0.0 *(2023-02-28)*
- Breaking change: renamed components: `Item` -> `MenuItem`, `Separator` -> `MenuSeparator`
- Refactored the folder structure


----


## v3.1.2 *(2023-01-04)*
- Toggle's `innerWidth` function was somehow overwriting `window.innerWidth` property (maybe a compiler issue?)


## v3.1.1 *(2023-01-04)*
- Fix `input-number` (could not enter decimals)
- Fix `input-math` (math didn't work)


## v3.1.0 *(2023-01-03)*
- UX change: autocomplete will not close on scroll or resize events from now on (it can be changed using new properties `hideOnScroll` and `hideOnResize`).
- fixed: autocomplete issue, where clicking on a filtered list would not select.
- tweak: autocomplete will now show "create new item" always (when enabled), not only when the query did not match anything. Except when the query matches an item exactly.


## v3.0.1 *(2022-12-30)*
- autocomplete should revert when entered value is not on the list


## v3.0.0 *(2022-12-28)*
- breaking change: `cssClass` property available on some components has been renamed to `className` (to be more aligned with the standard workaround in other libs/frameworks).
- some components (where possible) are now using `$$props` to pass-through the properties of the instance down to the component.


----


## v2.1.1 *(2022-12-24)*
- breaking change: `dist` folder has been renamed to `docs`, as this is the only allowed name for a GH pages folder so that the GH pages is published automatically (without writing a GH action specifically for this).


----


## v1.7.12 *(2022)*
